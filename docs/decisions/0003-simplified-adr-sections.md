# ADR-0003: Simplified ADR Sections

- Date: 2026-02-25
- Status: accepted
- Supersedes: none

## Context

Current ADR guidance and template include `Alternatives Considered` and `Consequences` sections. For this project, these sections are not required for documenting decisions made in chat.

## Decision

ADR records in `docs/decisions/` will require only `Context` and `Decision` sections, in addition to metadata (`Date`, `Status`, `Supersedes`).
